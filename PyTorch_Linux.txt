Tutorial for using C++ with PyTorch in Linux (Part 1)

For each step I want an answer that you have succeeded or if you have not succeeded, tell that and we will help you.

Steps:

1. I have tested in a virtual machine Ubuntu 14.04. I do not think it matters so much.
   So, do you have already a Linux OS ? Also, you can tell us what version of Linux do you have.

1.1 How to have a virtual machine with Ubuntu ?
      - Download Workstation 15 for Windows from here( you can also use VirtualBox): https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-pro/workstation-pro-evaluation.html
      - Install it and then Run it.
      - Download http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/14.04.0/ubuntu-14.04-desktop-amd64.iso

2.
   2.1 Open your Linux.

   2.2 Open a Terminal(Console). You just need one Terminal.

   2.3 Write this to your Terminal: mkdir CppTorch

   2.4 Write this to your Terminal: cd CppTorch

3.
   3.1 Open a browser in Linux.

   3.2 Go to this website https://pytorch.org/

   3.3 At Quick Start Locally:
      3.3.1 At PyTorch Build click Stable(1.0)
      3.3.2 At Your OS click Linux
      3.3.3 At Package click LibTorch
      3.3.4 At Language click C++
      3.3.5 At CUDA click None
      3.3.6 At Run this Command: we copy that link https://download.pytorch.org/libtorch/cpu/libtorch-shared-with-deps-latest.zip

   3.4 Go again to the previous Terminal(from 2.4) and:
       3.4.1 Run this: wget https://download.pytorch.org/libtorch/cpu/libtorch-shared-with-deps-latest.zip
       3.4.2 Run this: sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade && sudo apt install build-essential cmake unzip
       3.4.3 Unzip it: unzip libtorch-shared-with-deps-latest.zip

   3.5 Now we want to create a file named Linux_PyTorch.cpp, with some code and we will do like this:
       3.5.1 Go again to the previous Terminal(from 2.4)
       3.5.2 Run this: nano Linux_PyTorch.cpp
       3.5.3 I hope it's working the 3.5.2 step for all of you.
       3.5.4 An easy example of the the contents of Linux_PyTorch.cpp will be this(copy-paste):

                  #include<torch/torch.h>
                  #include<iostream>

                  int main(){

                  at::Tensor matrix = torch::rand({2,2});   // Here we create the matrix variable

                  std::cout << matrix;   // Here we output the the content of matrix variable

                  }

        3.5.5 To save the content(source code), you will press Ctrl + x , then press y.
        3.5.6 To be sure that you have saved the content in Linux_PyTorch.cpp please do this:
                   cat Linux_PyTorch.cpp

                    If you see the content, then you saved it successfully.

   3.6 Now we will create another file, named CMakeLists.txt.
      3.6.1 Go again to the previous Terminal(from 2.4)
      3.6.2 Run this: nano CMakeLists.txt
      3.6.3 The content for CMakeLists.txt will be this(copy-paste):

                 cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0 FATAL_ERROR)
                 project(Linux_PyTorch)

                 find_package(Torch REQUIRED)

                 add_executable(Linux_PyTorch Linux_PyTorch.cpp)
                 target_link_libraries(Linux_PyTorch "${TORCH_LIBRARIES}")
                 set_property(TARGET Linux_PyTorch PROPERTY CXX_STANDARD 11)

      3.6.4 To save the content, you will press Ctrl + x , then press y.
      3.6.5 To be sure that you have saved the content in CMakeLists.txt please do this:
                  cat CMakeLists.txt

                   If you see the content, then you saved it successfully.

   3.7 In the same Terminal, create a directory with the name build like this:
   
   Tutorial for using C++ with PyTorch in Linux (Part 2)

I get an error for the (Part 1) because the thread is too big, so I created another thread.

  3.8
     3.8.1 In your current directory from Terminal, write this command:
              ls

     3.8.2 In this moment, your current directory from Terminal should contains these:
               CMakeLists.txt
               Linux_PyTorch.cpp
               build
               libtorch

  3.9 - You have seen in the content of CMakeLists.txt that we have this line:
           cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0 FATAL_ERROR)

         - That line means that we need to have a tool, named cmake, with a minimum version 3.0, else we will get an error.

     3.9.1 To know what version of cmake do we have installed(or not), please write this command:
               cmake --version

     3.9.2 At me shows this: cmake version 3.13.2.

               If, at you, shows a number greater than 3.0, then you will skip this entire 3.9 step and go to 3.10 step.

               Else, it's no problem, I will help you to install cmake tool with version 3.13.2, which is bigger than 3.0. I did the same at me, because the first time I had a version less than 3.0.

     3.9.3 If you have a version less then 3.0 or is not installed, by getting this message The program 'cmake' is currently not installed. You can install it by typing:, we will need to install cmake with version 3.13.2(this is just an example of version)

     3.9.4 First, we neeed to remove the cmake tool, so please write this command:
               sudo apt remove cmake
     3.9.5 In Terminal go back to /CppTorch directory.
     3.9.6 Create Cmake directory in the /CppTorch directory: mkdir Cmake
     3.9.7 Go to /CppTorch/Cmake directory: cd Cmake
     3.9.8 Open a browser and go to this link of cmake webpage: https://cmake.org/download/
     3.9.9 Look at Latest Release (3.13.2) -> Platform -> Linux x86_64 ->  cmake-3.13.2-Linux-x86_64.sh
     3.9.10 Copy the link of cmake-3.13.2-Linux-x86_64.sh
     3.9.11 Now we will download the cmake-3.13.2-Linux-x86_64.sh file, so please write this:
                 wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.13.2/cmake-3.13.2-Linux-x86_64.sh
     3.9.12 Write this command: chmod +x cmake-3.13.2-Linux-x86_64.sh
     3.9.13 Write this command: sudo ./cmake-3.13.2-Linux-x86_64.sh
     3.9.14 If is asking your password, please write your password and press Enter.
     3.9.15 Then you will see some text. Here is a tricky part.
                  Keep pressing Enter till you see this text Do you accept the license ? [yN]:
                  If you missed it, please try again 3.9.13 step.
     3.9.16  Press y and press Enter.
     3.9.17 Press Y and it will create for you a /CppTorch/cmake/cmake-3.13.2-Linux-x86_64 directory
     3.9.18 Now we need to find the full path for /CppTorch/cmake/ , so please write this:
                    pwd
                 - At me, it is showing this: /home/mihail/CppTorch/Cmake/
                 - This full path will help you at 3.9.19 step.
     3.9.19 Next we need to create a Symbol link.
                 Here, please be careful to write the full path(according to your path from 3.9.18 step) and please write this(this is at me):
                 sudo ln -s /home/mihail/CppTorch/Cmake/cmake-3.13.2-Linux-x86_64/bin/ /usr/local/bin
   3.10 In Terminal, please go to your build directory.

   3.11 In terminal, write this, but please be careful to put YOUR FULL PATH for libtorch directory:
            cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/home/mihail/Desktop/CppTorch/libtorch ..

   3.12 Please write this: make

   3.13 Finally ! Please write this: ./Linux_PyTorch
